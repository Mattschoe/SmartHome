# Project Backlog — Smart Home Dashboard

Phased implementation roadmap. Each phase is the starting brief for a separate planning/build
session — sequential, grounded in the design specs (`app/docs/` + `CLAUDE.md`), open on
implementation detail. Do phases **in order**; each builds on the last.

## How to track progress (for agents)

- Each phase has a **status line** and a **checklist**. When you start a phase, set its status to
  `IN PROGRESS`. When it is finished **and** its verification gate passes, set the status to `DONE`,
  check every box in that phase, and fill in `Completed` (date + commit).
- Mark a box done by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. A phase is only `DONE` when all its boxes are checked.
- Do **not** mark a phase `DONE` until its verification gate (Android `/android-verify` +
  iOS compile check + tests where logic exists) actually passes — report failures instead.
- Keep this file the single source of truth for status; the full rationale lives in
  `/home/matt/.claude/plans/alright-claude-lets-setup-quirky-cascade.md`.

## Status legend

`TODO` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `DONE`

## Guardrails (apply to every phase)

**This is an opinionated, single-home dashboard — not a configurable product.** Fixed accent
(Forest), fixed clock format, fixed name, fixed room list. No user-facing configurability unless a
phase says so.

- **Icons**: Compose bundles no Material Symbols Rounded. Each phase **enumerates the exact icons it
  needs**; the user supplies assets *before* that phase executes. Never silently substitute `Icons.*`.
- **Verification gate (every phase)**: (1) Android build + `/android-verify` vs the reference
  screenshots (`app/docs/Dashboard_with_media.png`, `Dashboard_with_calendar.png`); (2) iOS
  compile-only — `cd app && ./gradlew :shared:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64` (Linux, no simulator);
  (3) `./gradlew allTests` where logic exists.
- **Common-first**; no hardcoded hex/type in composables; touch targets ≥ 44dp; fixed 1280×800,
  only card-internal regions scroll.

## Phase 1 — Theme & design-token foundation

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-04 (commit `1acf560`)

Make the theme the single source of truth so every later phase pulls colors/type from it.

- [x] `ui/theme/Color.kt` populated with all tokens (surface, card, border, ink, ink soft, muted,
      sage green, teal, rose, warm amber, inset) + fixed Forest accent (`#0A3323`/`#F6EEC7`).
- [x] Warmth-temperature colors (Candle→Cool) defined as tokens.
- [x] Typography finished: Newsreader 400/500/600 (currently only 400/700).
- [x] Reusable section-label style (uppercase ~10–11px, weight 500, ls ~1.5px, muted `#A7A88C`).
- [x] Swatch preview renders correctly on Android; iOS compiles.

## Phase 2 — Foundational state + mock data layer

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-08 (commit `918e368`, audio-model correction verified)

Land the reactive state layer early so all UI binds to a real `StateFlow` from day one.

> **Correction (2026-07-04):** the first pass modeled audio as a **global session** (`speaker`,
> `audioSource`, a global `MediaState`, `joinMusic()`) — wrong. Audio is now **per-room**, folded
> into `RoomState`; `playlists` is a shared library; there is no `speaker`/`audioSource`. Multi-room
> sync is deferred (see `CLAUDE.md` State Model CORE RULE).
>
> **Correction (2026-07-04):** UI-selection state (`activeRoom`/`panel`) was moved **out of the
> adapter** into `HomepageViewModel` — device data vs screen state separation. The adapter now
> exposes device-only `HomeState` (no `activeRoom`/`panel`, no `setActiveRoom`/`setPanel`); the VM
> owns the selection as `MutableStateFlow`s and `combine`+`stateIn`s them with the adapter flow into a
> sealed `HomeScreenState` (`Loading`/`Ready`). Re-run the verification gate before re-marking this
> phase `DONE`.

- [x] **Confirm the real room list with the user** before seeding fixtures.
      → Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom, Hall.
- [x] `Warmth`, `Room` enums, `RoomState`; device-only `HomeState` (rooms/climate/playlists/calendar)
      from the adapter, `HomeScreenState` (VM-owned `activeRoom`/`panel`) in the ViewModel.
      *(`RoomId`→`Room` per plan.)*
- [x] **Audio is per-room**: `RoomState` owns `volumePct`/`isPlaying`/`nowPlaying`/`positionSec`/`queue`;
      `HomeState` carries a shared `playlists` list. No `speaker`/`audioSource`/global `MediaState`.
- [x] `HomeAdapter` interface + `MockAdapter` seeded from fixtures (rooms/calendar/climate, one room
      playing), optimistic mutations, read-only climate.
- [x] `AppContainer` constructs `MockAdapter`; `HomepageViewModel` exposes `StateFlow`; `Homepage`
      collects via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
- [x] Signature math as testable pure functions (dial angle→value, volume fraction, room-swap).
- [x] Unit tests cover state transitions/math; iOS compiles. *(verified: `DashboardLogicTest`,
      `MockAdapterTest`, `HomepageViewModelTest` pass under `allTests`; iOS simulator target compiles.)*

## Phase 3 — Reusable primitives (component kit)

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-04 (commit `7eda795`)

Idempotent, stateless building blocks reused across all three cards.

- [x] `CardContainer` (cream, 1px border, radius 22, no shadow).
- [x] `SectionLabel`, `PillChip`/toggle chip (active = accent, idle = white + sage border).
- [x] `InsetSurface`, bottom scroll-fade overlay, icon wrapper (once assets exist).

---

## Phase 4 — Left card (date/time · climate · apps
> **Correction (2026-07-04):** Apps support have moved beyond the initial project backlog
> they should be seen as "additions" to the dashboard, and not vital for v1.

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-05 (commit `5724b8d`)

Assemble the fixed 288px left column.

- [x] **Enumerate + request icons** (climate stats: temp/humidity/energy/outdoor; app tiles).
- [x] Date/time header (clock ticks ~20s, fixed format).
- [x] 2×2 read-only climate stat tiles bound to mock climate.
- [x] Matches reference screenshots; iOS compiles.

---

## Phase 5 — Center card (signature interactions)

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-08 (light control `b8ca62d`; audio slider + a11y verified,
commit pending)

The hardest phase — brightness dial, warmth, audio (likely split into sub-steps).

- [x] **Enumerate + request icons** — three level-reactive volume glyphs supplied and wired
      (`volume_off_outline`, `volume_down_outline`, `volume_up_outline`). The speaker/room glyphs the
      original note mentioned were for the *deferred* multi-room speaker chips → not needed in v1.
- [x] Room chips swap the entire center-card state (per-room), no animation.
- [x] Brightness dial: Canvas half-arc + `pointerInput` drag (`value = round((1 − deg/180) × 100)`),
      center-bulb toggle, drag forces on, warmth-colored arc/knob, off-state grey + "Off".
- [x] Warmth swatches recolor the dial + turn light on; selected = scale 1.08 + double-ring halo.
- [x] Audio (**per-room**, selected **independently** of lights): a second room-chip row in the AUDIO
      section (speaker rooms only, `Room.hasSpeaker` → `Room.audioRooms`, with a speaker glyph) drives
      `activeAudioRoom`; the volume slider (`(x−left)/width`, Canvas track + drag/tap, leading glyph
      muted→down→up) binds to that room. The top chips remain lights-only.
      *Deferred from v1: the "Whole home" speaker chip and dashed "Join the music in {source}" — that's
      the multi-room grouping feature, not part of the per-room model (see CLAUDE.md CORE RULE).*
- [x] Slider a11y + arrow-key adjustment on dial and slider. *(Compose has no `Role.Slider`; slider
      semantics are conveyed by `progressBarRangeInfo` + `setProgress`, plus DirectionUp/Down/Left/Right
      key handling that nudges ±5. Applied to both the dial and the volume slider.)*
- [x] Touch drag works on-device; room-swap swaps all state (dial + volume); warmth↔dial linkage;
      iOS compiles. *(Verified via `/android-verify`: tap/drag sets volume 89%→1%, glyph tracks the
      level, switching Stue→Køkken swaps the shown volume to that room's own state.)*

## Phase 6 — Right card, Media panel

**Status:** `TODO` · **Completed:** —

Media/Calendar tab shell + Media content.

- [x] **Enumerate + request icons** (search, transport, shuffle/repeat).
- [x] Pill segmented control (Media | Calendar, one active).
- [x] Media binds to the **active room's** audio (`RoomState.nowPlaying`/`queue`); the empty state is
      simply *that room has nothing playing*. Playlists rail reads the shared `DashboardState.playlists`.
- [x] Media: search, now-playing + scrubber, transport row, vertical "Up next" queue,
      horizontal scroll-snap "Playlists" rail, 40px bottom fade.
- [x] Matches `Dashboard_with_media.png`; tab switch + scroll work; iOS compiles.

---

## Phase 7 — Right card, Calendar panel

**Status:** `TODO` · **Completed:** —

Calendar content behind the same tab shell.

- [x] **Enumerate + request icons** (month nav arrows, checklist/checkbox).
- [x] Month grid (today = accent cell) + prev/next month arrows.
- [x] "Today" agenda list with colored dots + "To-do" checklist.
- [x] Matches `Dashboard_with_calendar.png`; month nav works; iOS compiles.

---


## Phase 8 — Real Home Assistant (HAOS) integration

**Status:** `DONE` · **Completed:** 2026-07-11 (commit pending)

Replace the mock with real device I/O behind the `HomeAdapter` seam.

- [x] **Discuss HA instance, auth, and entity IDs with the user** at the start of this phase.
      → Instance `http://192.168.1.40:8123`, long-lived token in `local.properties` (`ha.url`/`ha.token`).
      Rooms auto-discovered from HA Areas (English names match the `Room` enum constants). Speakers were
      assigned to Areas by the user so both lights and `media_player`s discover uniformly.
- [x] `HomeAssistantAdapter` (WebSocket) mapping entities → lights + `media_player`. Climate/calendar/todo
      have no entities yet → emitted **blank** (climate tiles render "—"). Lights are **area-targeted**
      (rooms have several lamps): writes hit `target: {area_id}`, reads aggregate every lamp in the area.
      Warmth↔Kelvin, brightness 0–255↔%, volume 0–1↔% conversions are pure + unit-tested.
- [x] Swap `MockAdapter → HomeAssistantAdapter` in `AppContainer` — **config-driven**: a non-blank
      `ha.token` (Android `BuildConfig` from `local.properties`) selects the live adapter, else `MockAdapter`
      (iOS/previews). Android manifest gained INTERNET + `usesCleartextTraffic` for the LAN `ws://`.
- [x] Controls actuate real devices; state reflects live HA; verified against the live instance.
      *(On-device: app shows live now-playing/volume/light state + blank climate; bulb-toggle turned
      `light.stue_dining_room_lamp` off/on in HA; an HA-side brightness change pushed the dial 100%→37%
      live. iOS compiles; `allTests` green.)*
- [ ] **Follow-up (not blocking):** Media panel `queue`/playlists are empty on the real adapter — HA
      `media_player` exposes no standard play-queue. Revisit if a queue source (e.g. `media_player`
      browse or an integration attribute) is wanted.

## Phase 9 - After Home Assistan connection

This is a loose list of things to do after HAOS backend is up and running:

- [ ] Mobile phone support
- [ ] "weekly" calendar view
